# Engineering-Solutions-Lab
A collection of hands-on engineering projects, including gRPC services, HTTP proxy microservices, feature engineering pipelines, and production-ready business logic, focused on real-world implementations rather than algorithmic research.

## 1. [http-proxy](http-proxy/) 
Microservice Unified Proxyï¼Œa lightweight proxy layer for microservices, designed to provide a consistent and unified interface across different services.
This project simplifies service integration by:
- Exposing a standardized API gateway for all microservices
- Hiding internal service complexity behind a unified proxy
- Enabling easier scaling, monitoring, and maintenance of distributed systems
